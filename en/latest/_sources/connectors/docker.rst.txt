``@docker`` Connector
---------------------

The docker connector allows you to build Docker images or modify running
Docker containers. You can pass either an image name or existing container ID:

+ Image - will create a new container from the image, execute operations         against it, save into a new Docker image and remove the container
+ Existing container ID - will execute operations against the running         container, leaving it running

.. code:: shell

    # A Docker base image must be provided
    pyinfra @docker/alpine:3.8 ...

    # pyinfra can run on multiple Docker images in parallel
    pyinfra @docker/alpine:3.8,@docker/ubuntu:bionic ...

    # Execute against a running container
    pyinfra @docker/2beb8c15a1b1 ...
