``@docker`` Connector
---------------------


The ``@docker`` connector allows you to build Docker images, or modify running
Docker containers, using ``pyinfra``. You can pass either an image name or
existing container ID:

+ Image - will create a container from the image, execute operations and save
    into a new image
+ Existing container ID - will simply execute operations against the container,
    leaving it up afterwards


.. code:: shell

    # A Docker base image must be provided
    pyinfra @docker/alpine:3.8 ...

    # pyinfra can run on multiple Docker images in parallel
    pyinfra @docker/alpine:3.8,@docker/ubuntu:bionic ...

    # Execute against a running container
    pyinfra @docker/2beb8c15a1b1 ...

Usage
~~~~~

.. code:: python

    pyinfra @docker/image ...
